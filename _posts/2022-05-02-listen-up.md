I recently attended Simulations Arcade Hack CTF! It was an individual competition that was designed for beginners, but I wanted some challenges so I decided to play.
I managed to get first blood on this challenge and was also the only participant who succefully solved it. It boiled down to getting a copy of the ``.wav`` file with
rtmpdump and viewing the waveform to see that it is a binary encoding.
# Listen Up! (1 solve, 100 points)
## Description
Cerby seems to like listening to radio from his website a lot, but we cannot figure out why. Do you have any idea what he is up to?

Notes: Don't take everything at surface value. Maybe the listening doesn't matter either. Also save this challenge for last to save you trouble :)

## Solution
So the context of this challenge is a follow up to one of the previous OSINT challenges in the competition. In that challenge you find Cerby's github account and look
at the commit history to find the flag. There is another tidbit of information in the commit history though. Cerby makes a change to the ``README.md`` file that says
``new site: cerby.space``
Upon visiting this site there is a simple message displayed:
``rtmp://64.227.11.108/live/numbers``

I had not seen this type of address before so I looked up ``rtmp`` on google and visited this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol) article.
Browsing through the article we find the ``software implementations`` section which reads ``The open-source RTMP client command-line tool rtmpdump is designed to play back or save to disk the full RTMP stream, including the RTMPE protocol Adobe uses for encryption.``

Great! This sounds perfect! With ``sudo apt install rtmpdump`` we can get this on our ubuntu VM. Next I ran ``rtmpdump -h`` to get the usage message:
```
RTMPDump v2.4

If you don't pass parameters for swfUrl, pageUrl, or auth these properties will not be included in the connect packet.
```
This line seems to match what we need:
```
--rtmp|-r url           URL (e.g. rtmp://host[:port]/path)
```
Experimenting with the command I could see that it just dumps the recieved bytes to ``stdout``. I redirected the output to a file and saved it as ``flag.wav``. 
This makes the final command ``rtmpdump -r rtmp://64.227.11.108/live/numbers > ./flag.wav``.
I let this run until it momentarily stopped recieving input which I assumed was the end of the transmition. This assumption was correct.

I played the file and didn't really hear anything. As is typical with audio steg challenges, the next step is to open the file in a waveform viewer for more carefull
analysis. I use [audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) for this type of thing. 
This is what we get:

It doesn't look like much at first but it's always a good idea to zoom in to look at the details of the wave form:
![image](/img/wave.png)

This tells a different story. I noticed some key things about this waveform:
* There are two different audio pulses
    * Short
    * Tall
* There is a small gap in between groups
* These pulses are in groups of 8

This all fits with binary encoding! For those unfamiliar, characters in the computer are represented in memory using sets of binary bits (1s and 0s). There are
256 different characters that can be represented this way, and because of this, we need a set of 8 bits to represent one character. For example, the ``A`` character
is ``01000001`` in binary. If we enterpret the small pulses as 0's and the big ones as 1's, then we get sets of 8 bits, each encoding a character. Starting from left
to right we get ``01010011 01000001 01001000``. This just so happens to translate to ``SAH`` which is our flag prefix!

I use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) for quick online encoding and decoding like this so typing the rest of our binary data there gives us the flag!
