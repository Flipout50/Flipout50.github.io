Hello, I'm a hacker and ctf enthusiast who will be studying Computer Science at ASU. I currently play ctfs
with [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/) and my high school team BASHing_Thru_Challenges.
I am also an active member of the [ASU Hacking Club](https://asuhacking.club). This is my ctf blog. Here
I post about the ctf competitions I play and my writeups for interesting challenges I solve. If you want
to contact me, feel free to send an email with any questions.
