title: About Me

Hello, I'm a hacker and ctf enthusiast studying Computer Science and Mathematics at ASU. I currently play ctfs
with [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/) and occasionally other small teams for specific competitions.
I am also the Vice President of the [ASU Hacking Club](https://asuhacking.club). This is my ctf technical blog. Here
I post about the ctf competitions I play and my writeups for interesting challenges I come across.
